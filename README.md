# simple_crud
This is my first php project. Pff Who am I kidding? This is my first working piece of code. lol. 
I followed this excellent tutorial from Kristian Guevara @ www.codeproject.com. I kinda just learned reiterated the code with some modifications. Used bootstrap for css framework because that's like the only css framework that i'm familiar with.

P.S: I'm a really really really novice/rookie programmer and I required tonnes of feedback!
